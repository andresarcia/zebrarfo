	A measurement campaign defines what we call a Place. This is regularly composed of many individual text files captured by a single device. We provide scripts that can process the data in the raw format (the one provided by the device alone) and convert it to Zebra RFO input format
	<br>
	<br>
	Zebra RFO uses data formatted as follows. A single text file contains a location (LAT and LON) with a set of frequencies out of a bandwidth:
	<br>
	<br>
	<div class='well well-sm'>
		frequency_1 \\t power_1
		<br>
		frequency_2 \\t power_2
		<br>
		...
		<br>
		frequency_n \\t power_n
		<br>
		latitude
		<br>
		longitude
		<br>
		date of capture
	</div>
	Please download the script according to your input device:
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Android device</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	If you are using the android application to capture the spectrum activity (with RFExplorer), you can download the following script in python (
	<a href='javascript:void(0)' id='download-android-parser-v1'>
		android parser
	</a>
	), copy the script into the folder where your captured data is located. Then run the script as follows:
	<br>
	<br>
	<div class='well well-sm'>
		python android_parser.py
	</div>
	As a result, the script generate a folder of parsed data in Zebra RFO format, ready to be uploaded (and consumed) by the system. Then proceed as follows:
	<br>
	<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Name the zone</li>
		<li>Select all the parsed files (*.txt) which are numbered from 1 to N</li>
		<li>Select the common unit of the frequency sample (for Android should be kilohertz) </li>
		<li>Click on Synchronise</li>
	</ol>
	Wait for the processing.
	<br>
	<br>
	Now you can visualise your dataâ€¦
	<br>
	<br>
	Enjoy!
